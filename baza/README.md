The document called `PLAN KONT` contains data about all people (members and not members).

Not all people are members of the association.

If someone in a member then he or she has their unique registry number (PL: numer kartoteki).

Long-time members have also the old registry numbers; at some point of time old (paper) registry numbers were discarded.
