# Domain facts

The document called `PLAN KONT` contains data about all people (members and not members).

Not all people are members of the association.

## Registry numbers

There are two types of registry numbers - both are optional!:
* registry numbers
* old registry numbers

If someone in a member then he or she should have their unique registry number (PL: numer kartoteki).
Long-time members have also the old registry numbers; at some point of time old (paper) registry numbers were discarded.

Registry numbers start with index 1
